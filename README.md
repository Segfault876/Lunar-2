# Lunar-2
A sequel to Lunar Game Studio, massive code quality changes.

Lunar 2 is a game engine written in C++ with a Lua front-end for
videogame development. Running on SDL2, the programmer can create
sprites, texutres, sounds, and windows entirely in Lua. The engine
was built to be as simple yet scalable as possible, but is not
by any means suitable for commercial use as it has many limitations
likely due to me being 17 when I wrote it.
